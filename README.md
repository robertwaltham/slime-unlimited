# Slime Unlimited

This is an extension of my [Boids Unlimited](https://github.com/robertwaltham/boids-unlimited) project, this time simulating slime mold.

Like the previous project, this hosts a MTKView within SwiftUI using an UIViewRepresentable, and uses a kernel compute shader to update and draw the simulation.
